#### Description: 
Common.Good is a very basic social media site for organizing recommendations from friends. Content is all categorized, and users can add new categories if their post doesn't fit in any existing categories. The site includes basic profiles with pictures, descriptions, and a readout of all of the user's posts. All user data is maintained across four tables in a database. I'm also very proud of the sidebar and the bar on top that replaces it. The home page has two different modes depending on whether the user is logged in or not. If the user is logged in, they will see all posts made by friends ordered chronologically. If they are not logged in, they will see all posts ordered chronologically. Users who are not logged in will only have access to the buttons on the side bar for registration, logging in, viewing the homepage and viewing all posts in their searchable form on read page. Users will gain access to the logout function when they log in, as well as their own profile, friends list, write function and settings. The profile also has two different modes depending on if the user is viewing their own profile or another user's profile. If the user is viewing their own profile, they will have the option to change the url of their profile picture and also to change their profile description. If they are viewing another user's profile, they will have the option to add or remove that user as a friend
