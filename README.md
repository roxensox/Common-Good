# Common.Good
#### Video Demo: TODO
#### Description:
Common.Good is a very basic social media site for organizing recommendations from friends. Content is all categorized, and users can add new categories if their post doesn't fit in any existing categories. The site includes basic profiles with pictures, descriptions, and a readout of all of the user's posts. All user data is maintained across four tables in a database. I'm also very proud of the sidebar and the bar on top that replaces it.
